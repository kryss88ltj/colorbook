        <p>Leaf green is the sexy nurse of the color world - She's compassionate, kind and represents healing and growth. It is an extremely clean color, particularly in the US. Leaf green has the ability to make a package look
        eco-friendly and environmental. When mixed with a little bit of black, leaf green appears fat-free. Leaf green is also the color of correction and fixing mistakes.</p>

        <p class="para-2">Story time: The Blackfriar bridge in London was a popular jumping spot for suicidal englishmen. It got so bad that they decided to paint the black, desolate bridge a more refreshing shade of green. They hoped to take advantage of the healing and stress-reducing nature of green.</p>
